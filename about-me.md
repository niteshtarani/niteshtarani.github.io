I'm a passionate developer with over 10 years of experience building software systems. My journey began when Android 3.0 was launched. Yes, I've been around for a while! Over the years, I've specialized in Android development while also gaining extensive experience with iOS and cross-platform solutions using Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile.

## Technical Expertise

Beyond mobile development, I've developed a strong foundation in backend engineering, working with microservices architectures to build scalable, resilient, and fault-tolerant systems. This full-stack perspective allows me to create comprehensive solutions that seamlessly integrate front-end and back-end technologies.

## Professional Journey

After completing my postgraduate studies at **IIT Roorkee**, I joined [Limeroad](https://www.limeroad.com/) as an Android developer, where I owned the end-to-end development of their e-commerce application. This role gave me a solid foundation in building consumer-facing mobile products at scale.

I then moved to [Hike Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hike_Messenger), where I had the opportunity to work on core features of a messaging app used by millions of users. This experience deepened my understanding of real-time communication systems and performance optimization for high-traffic applications.

Next, I joined [Directi](https://www.directi.com/) ([Titan](https://titan.email/)) as a Senior Software Engineer and grew into a Lead Mobile Engineer role, where I led the mobile team and also contributed to the backend development for enterprise grade email solutions.

Currently, I'm part of the [Target](https://target.com/) team as a Lead Engineer, where I focus on enhancing the shopping experience for millions of users across the United States. In this role, I leverage my full-stack expertise to drive impactful improvements to Target's digital platforms.

## Entrepreneurial Experience

I've had the privilege of co-founding two startups. While neither venture achieved long-term success, these experiences were invaluable in teaching me about business operations, product development, and leadership. The lessons learned have shaped me into a more well-rounded professional with a deeper understanding of how technology intersects with business needs.

## Current Interests

In my free time, I explore emerging technologies and experiment with new frameworks. I'm particularly fascinated by Large Language Models (LLMs) and have built several projects utilizing generative AI and open-source models from Hugging Face. This hands-on experience has given me practical insights into the real-world applications of AI in software development and how it's transforming the industry.
