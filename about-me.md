I am a developer who absolutely loves building Mobile apps. I have been building mobile apps since last 10 years. Starting all the way when Android version 2.0 was launched. Yes I am that old :) 
Apart from android I have also build iOS and cross platform apps with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile for around 2 years. 

After completing my post graduation from IIT Roorkee, I joined [Limeroad](https://www.limeroad.com/) as an Android developer where I owned the end-to-end development of the e-commerce app. Post that I moved on to working at [Hike Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hike_Messenger) where I got the opportunity to work on many core features of the messaging app.

I am curretly working in [Directi](https://www.directi.com/) ([Titan](https://titan.email/)) as a Senior Software Engineer / Mobile lead. 

I have also had opportunity to co-found 2 start-ups. While neither venture achieved long-term success, the experiences were transformative, teaching me a lot of things about businesses. The lessons have shaped me into a better professional.

In my free time I love reading about new technologies and trying them out. Current favourite being LLMs where I've built several small-scale projects utilizing generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically working with open-source models from Hugging Face. It allowed me to explore practical applications of AI in software development with the hands-on experience.
